/** The controller for managing a `TURecipientsBar`.
 
 You can use this class to enable searching, as well as many other features.
 
 A recipients display controller manages the display of a recipients bar, along with
 a table view that displays search results.
 
 You initialize a recipients display controller with a recipients bar and a view controller
 responsible for managing the recipients and data to be searched. When the user starts a
 search, the recipients display controller superimposes the search interface over the original
 view controller’s view and shows the search results in its table view.
